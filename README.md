# Happy-Unhappy Deep Learning Project

### Libraries

This project requires the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Keras - Sequential Model](https://keras.io/guides/sequential_model/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)


### Code

Code is provided in the `Happy-Unhappy` notebook file. Also included, are the `train_happy.h5` and `test_happy.h5` dataset files.


### Data

Basically, a smile detector!

The train set has 600 examples.
The test set has 150 examples.

Source: This dataset is gathered from the Deep Learning Specialization - Convolutional Neural Network Course - Week 2 - Happy House Exercise.
